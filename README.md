**Do you need a website and workflow management platform?** Here are a few triggers.

* Production is down.
* We need a test site.
* Why is this costing so much?
* Are my environments safe? 
* Is my website backed up?
* How quickly can I recover my website after a disaster?
* Can I easily scale my website for more traffic?
* What is my uptime?

**What makes Catapult different?**

* Catapult is an open-source, complete, and distributed architecture
* Catapult only orchestrates - it is not required to run your infrastructure
* Catapult uses platform native shell scripting rather than configuration management tools such as Chef, Puppet, or Salt
* Catapult features Gitflow workflow while enforcing exactly matching, branch-driven environments
* Catapult features a unique software workflow model - upstream or downstream
* Catapult overlays seamlessly with Scrum methodology
* Catapult is very cost-effective

*Go ahead, give* **Catapult** *a* **shot**.

If you do not see your website software listed, Catapult supports basic PHP projects that do not have a database requirement.

* When an above software type is not defined, the default PHP version that is used is PHP 5.4. This is not configurable.
* PHP-less static site generators, such as, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), are supported.

### PHP Versions ###

Catapult maintains a high level of integrity when it comes to PHP versions, through maintaining security, backwards compatibility, performance, and new features. Below is an overview of the PHP versions used in Catapult and when you can expect these versions to be End-of-Life (EOL). We will bump to the next highest version of PHP in the list when nearing the EOL - this provides ample time for support of the newer PHP version by the software. In cases where a software version is sunsetting, the CentOS Long-term Support (LTS) version of PHP is used.

PHP Version | End-of-Life | Maintainer | Updater
------------|-------------|------------|--------
5.4 | June 30, 2024 | [CentOS](https://wiki.centos.org/FAQ/General#head-fe8a0be91ee3e7dea812e8694491e1dde5b75e6d) | [Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/backporting)
7.1 | December 1, 2019 | [Software Collections](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/rh-php71/) | [Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhscl-rhel7)
7.2 | November 30, 2020 | [Software Collections](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/rh-php72/) | [Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhscl-rhel7)
7.3 | June 30, 2024 | [Jan Staněk](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/jstanek/rh-php73/) | [Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhscl-rhel7)

### End-of-Life (EOL) ###

Catapult tracks vendor announced EOL dates for website software and a red EOL date will be displayed during `vagrant status` if one of your website's software is EOL. Currently Catapult has no plan to block Catapult supported software that is past its EOL date - it is up to you to move to the next major supported version.

## Platform Comparision ##

Here, we compare similar platforms to shed light on where we are and we're headed. Catapult's approach is holistic, meaning, there are no optional features - the platform includes everything in its default state and its default state is the only state of the platform. Some platforms offer and support optional third-party features that need configured - these are excluded.

# Setup Catapult #

Catapult requires a [Developer Setup](#developer-setup), [Instance Setup](#instance-setup), and [Services Setup](#services-setup) as described in the following sections.

There are two roles when using Catapult, Catapult User and Catapult Admin.

* Catapult Users are developers who use Catapult for developing within the websites that the Catapult Admin has added and configured
* Catapult Admins are administrators who setup their organization's Catapult instance and required services

The Catapult User only needs to complete the [Developer Setup](#developer-setup) and the Catapult Admin completes the [Instance Setup](#instance-setup) and [Services Setup](#services-setup).

**Please Note:**
* It is advised to turn off any antivirus software that you may have installed during setup and usage of Catapult - tasks such as forwarding ports and writing hosts files may be blocked.
* Virtualizaion must be enabled in the BIOS of the developer's workstation - follow [this how-to](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5/html/Virtualization/sect-Virtualization-Troubleshooting-Enabling_Intel_VT_and_AMD_V_virtualization_hardware_extensions_in_BIOS.html) to get started.
* It is recommended to disable Internet Service Provider (ISP) Domain Name System (DNS) helpers, such as opting out of the [Verizon DNS Assitance](https://www.verizon.com/support/residential/internet/home-network/settings/opt-out-of-dns-assist).
* Using a VPN client during usage of LocalDev may result in lost communication between your workstation and the guests, requiring a `vagrant reload` to regain communication.

       4. Contact your Catapult admin for your Catapult instance's GPG passphrase and place at `~/secrets/configuration-user.yml["settings"]["gpg_key"]`
       5. You may stop at this point and contact your Catapult admin for the next steps. The following [Instance Setup](#instance-setup) and [Services Setup](#services-setup) will be or have been, completed by your Catapult admin
    3. **Any role: personal accounts**:
       1. Users can choose to specify a personal Bamboo user (rather than the company user) for certain Bamboo calls that originate locally
           1. Set `~/secrets/configuration-user.yml["settings"]["bamboo_username"]` to the username for this Bamboo user
           2. Set `~/secrets/configuration-user.yml["settings"]["bamboo_password"]` to the password for this Bamboo user
 8. If you are a Catapult User, contact your Catapult Admin for next steps. If you are a Catapult Admin, continue to the [Instance Setup](#instance-setup) and [Services Setup](#services-setup).

## Instance Setup ##

Catapult is quick to setup. You have the option of using GitHub (public) or Bitbucket (private) to store your Catapult instance. Your Catapult secrets are encrypted and safe, but please use your best judgment when choosing a destination for your Catapult instance.

1. **Fork Catapult**
    * **GitHub (public)**
        1. Fork https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/catapult and clone via SourceTree or the Git utility of your choice.
    * **BitBucket (private)**
        1. From BitBucket, create a new repository and import https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/catapult. Then clone via SourceTree or the Git utility of your choice.
2. **Admin Mode**
    1. Once cloned, from your workstation's terminal, change the directory into the root of the newly cloned Catapult repository
    2. Run `vagrant status` to verify the correct workstation software is installed and to generate your Catapult user files
    3. Set `~/secrets/configuration-user.yml["settings"]["admin"]` to `true`
    4. Enable Git credential caching by following the instructions outlined for your system to [store your Git credentials](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git)
3. **GPG Edit Mode**
    1. **GPG Edit Mode** is set at `~/secrets/configuration-user.yml["settings"]["gpg_edit"]` (`false` by default) and is used to encrypt your Catapult configuration secrets using your **GPG Passphrase**:
        1. `~/secrets/id_rsa` as `~/secrets/id_rsa.gpg`
        2. `~/secrets/id_rsa.pub` as `~/secrets/id_rsa.pub.gpg`
        3. `~/secrets/configuration.yml` as `~/secrets/configuration.yml.gpg`
    1. **GPG Edit Mode** requires that you are on your Catapult fork's `develop` branch.
    3. Running any Vagrant command (e.g. `vagrant status`) will encrypt your configuration, of which, will allow you to commit and push safely to your public Catapult fork.
4. **SSH Key Pair**
    1. Create a *passwordless* SSH key pair - this will drive authentication for Catapult.
        1. For instructions please see https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/
        2. Place the newly created *passwordless* SSH key pair `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` in the `~/secrets/` folder.
5. **GPG Passphrase**
    1. Generate a GPG passphrase 
        1. This passphrase is used to encrypt and decrypt your Catapult instance's configuration file.
        2. NEVER SHARE THE PASSPHRASE WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN YOUR TEAM.
        3. Spaces are not permitted and must be at least 20 characters.
        4. To create a strong passphrase, please visit https://xkpasswd.net/
        5. Place your newly generated passphrase at `~/secrets/configuration-user.yml["settings"]["gpg_key"]`
        6. It is recommended to print a QR code of the passphrase to distribute to your team, please visit http://educastellano.github.io/qr-code/demo/
        7. Remember! Effective security is equal parts process and technology.

# Release Management #

Catapult follows Gitflow for its **infrastructure configuration** *and* **website development** model - each environment is branch-based and changesets are introduced into each environment by pull requests from one branch to the next.

## Software Workflow ##

Catapult enforces a unique solution to Release Management of a website, Software Workflow. Software Workflow offers two modes, downstream or upstream, creating a "golden environment".

## Catapult Configuration ##

All Catapult configuration is stored in `~/secrets/configuration.yml` and encrypted as `~/secrets/configuration.yml.gpg`. There are three main sections - [Company](#company), [Environments](#environments), and [Websites](#websites).

### Company ###

The exclusive Company entry contains top-level company information and service credentials, configured during [Setup Catapult](#setup-catapult).

* `name:`
    * required: yes
        * Your company's name or your name
* `email:`
    * required: yes
        * The primary contact email
* `timezone_redhat:`
    * required: yes
        * Your company's timezone in tz database format
        * See [this list](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.1/html/Developer_Guide/appe-REST_API_Guide-Timezones.html) for a list of valid tz database format timezones
* `timezone_windows:`
    * required: yes
        * Your company's timezone in Windows Standard Format
        * See [this list](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.1/html/Developer_Guide/appe-REST_API_Guide-Timezones.html) for a list of valid Windows Standard Format timezones

The remaining keys include credentials to services:

* `digitalocean_personal_access_token`
* `bitbucket_username`
* `bitbucket_password`
* `github_username`
* `github_password`
* `github_personal_access_token`
* `bamboo_base_url`
* `bamboo_username`
* `bamboo_password`
* `aws_access_key`
* `aws_secret_key`
* `bamboo_password`
* `cloudflare_api_key`
* `cloudflare_email`
* `newrelic_admin_api_key`
* `newrelic_api_key`
* `newrelic_license_key`
* `sendgrid_api_key`
* `sendgrid_username`
* `sendgrid_password`


### Environments ###

The setup- and maintenance-free Environments entries contain environment configurations such as IP addresses and system credentials - all of which are automatically set during [Setup Catapult](#setup-catapult) and [Setup Environments](#setup-environments).

### Websites ###

Adding websites to Catapult is driven by simple configuration. After establishing a repository at GitHub or Bitbucket, simply add entries to `~/secrets/configuration.yml`. The entries must be ordered alphabetically by domain name and all entries exist under the single `websites:` key as reflected in this example:
```
websites:
  apache:
  - domain: devopsgroup.io
    repo: git@github.com:devopsgroup-io/devopsgroup-io.git
  - domain: example.com
    repo: git@github.com:example-company/example.com.git
```

The following options are available:

* `domain:`
    * required: yes
    * example: `domain: example.com`
    * example: `domain: subdomain.example.com`
        * this root domain entry is the Production canonical domain name without `www.`
            * a `www.` subdomain is created for you
            * the key for all management orchestration of this website
        * one subdomain level is supported for this root domain entry (`subdomain.example.com`)
        * manages DNS of LocalDev (via hosts file) and Test, QC, Production (via CloudFlare)
            * `dev.example.com`, `test.example.com`, `qc.example.com`, `example.com`
            * `www.dev.example.com`, `www.test.example.com`, `www.qc.example.com`, `www.example.com`
* `domain_tld_override:`
    * default: not set
    * required: no
    * example: `domain_tld_override: mycompany.com`
        * a domain name under your [name server authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Authoritative_name_server) to append to the top-level-domain (e.g. `.com`)
            * configures a vhost at the `domain` and `domain`.`domain_tld_override`
            * useful when you do not have DNS control of the `domain`, but want to have a quick option to point DNS to `domain` if needed
            * if DNS is pointed to `domain`, you may remove the `domain_tld_override`. please caution note below
        * appends the `domain_tld_override` for Environments
            * `dev.example.com.mycompany.com`, `test.example.com.mycompany.com`, `qc.example.com.mycompany.com`, `example.com.mycompany.com`
            * `www.dev.example.com.mycompany.com`, `www.test.example.com.mycompany.com`, `www.qc.example.com.mycompany.com`, `www.example.com.mycompany.com`
        * PLEASE NOTE: When removing this option from a website with `software:`, you need to manually replace URLs in the database respective to the `software_workflow:` option.
            * ie `vagrant ssh mycompany.com-test-redhat-mysql`
            * `wp-cli --allow-root --path="/var/www/repositories/apache/example.com/(webroot if applicable)" search-replace ":\/\/(www\.)?(dev\.|test\.)?(example\.com\.mycompany\.com)" "://example.com" --regex`
* `configure_email:`
    * default: `true`
    * required: no
    * option: `configure_email: false`
        * should be used for when there is an already configured email provider at this website's domain
        * disables creating dns spf records for the website's dns zone
        * disables configuring website software smtp settings
* `force_auth:`
    * default: not set
    * required: no
    * example: `force_auth: letmein`
        * forces [HTTP basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) in LocalDev, Test, QC, and Production (see `force_auth_exclude`)
        * `letmein` is both the username and password
* `force_auth_exclude:`
    * default: not set
    * required: no
    * dependency: `force_auth:`
    * example: `force_auth_exclude: ["production"]`
        * array of select environments `["dev","test","qc","production"]` to exclude from the `force_auth` option
* `force_https:`
    * default: `false`
    * required: no
    * option: `force_https: true`
        * rewrites all http traffic to https
        * all `dev.` domains in LocalDev will have an unsigned certificate warning
        * free certificates are created and managed for you compliments of CloudFlare (single-subdomain) and Let's Encrypt (multi-subdomain)
* `force_ip:`
    * default: not set
    * example: `force_ip: ["208.80.154.224"]`
        * an array of valid IPv4 or IPv6 addresses that denies all traffic except for traffic coming from the defined addresses
        * option applies to LocalDev, Test, QC, and Production unless `force_ip_exclude` is defined
        * can be used as an alternative to `force_auth` for when HTTP basic authentication cannot be used. e.g. [Drupal 8 Basic Auth Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2842858)
        * can be used in addition to `force_auth` for added security
* `force_ip_exclude:`
    * default: not set
    * required: no
    * dependency: `force_ip:`
    * example: `force_ip_exclude: ["production"]`
        * array of select environments `["dev","test","qc","production"]` to exclude from the `force_ip` option
* `idle:`
    * default: `false`
    * required: no
    * option: `idle: true`
        * used for websites that are not under active software development
        * turns off all website operations in the dev and test environment, including git pulls and database refreshing
        * turns off nightly database backups in the test (upstream software workflow) and production (downstream software workflow) environments, hosting provider snapshots should be used for backups
* `repo:`
    * required: yes
    * example: `repo: git@github.com:devopsgroup-io/devopsgroup-io.git`
        * the existing source code repository of your website (repo automatically created if none exists)
        * GitHub and Bitbucket over SSH are supported, HTTPS is not supported
* `software:`
    * default: not set
    * required: no
    * description: manages many aspects of software respective to each environment for websites with supported software types
        * php version

## Website Development ##

Website development is done on the developer's workstation using the LocalDev environment for local and real-time software development in an environment that is exactly matching to upstream environments.

### Website Repositories ###

Once websites are added to your configuration and you have performed a provision of your LocalDev environment, repositories for websites are cloned into your Catapult instance at `~/repositories` and into the respective `apache` or `iis` folder, listed by the domain name. Website repository folders are linked between the developer's workstation (host) and the LocalDev environment (guest) for real-time development.

### Software Fresh Installs ###

Catapult enforces software configuration best practices for software fresh installs. A typical software fresh install workflow would be to fork the software project on GitHub and add then add a new website entry to your `~/configuration.yml` file. Given the broad spectrum of software requirements there are minor configuration caveats worth noting:

Software | Install Approach | Install Notes

`codeigniter3`      |          | Follow the [Installation Instructions](https://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/installation/index.html).
`concrete58`        | Download | Download [concrete5](https://www.concrete5.org/download).
`drupal6`           | Drush    | `drush pm-download drupal-6`
`drupal7`           | Drush    | `drush pm-download drupal-7`
`drupal8`           | Drush    | `drush pm-download drupal-8`
`elgg1`             | Fork     | Follow the installation [Overview](http://learn.elgg.org/en/2.0/intro/install.html). Catapult requires the `dataroot` directory to be within the webroot, it's pertinent to create a `.gitignore` to ignore and `.htaccess` to deny access to this directory.
`elgg2`             | Fork     | Follow the installation [Overview](http://learn.elgg.org/en/2.0/intro/install.html). Catapult requires the `dataroot` directory to be within the webroot, it's pertinent to create a `.gitignore` to ignore and `.htaccess` to deny access to this directory.
`expressionengine3` | Download |
`joomla3`           | Fork     |
`laravel5`          | Composer | Follow the [Composer Create-Project](https://laravel.com/docs/5.0/installation) documentation.
`mediawiki1`        | Fork     |
`moodle3`           | Fork     | Catapult requires the `moodledata` directory to be within the webroot, it's pertinent to create a `.gitignore` to ignore and `.htaccess` to deny access to this directory.
`silverstripe3`     | Composer | Follow the [Installing and Upgrading with Composer](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/3.4/getting_started/composer/). During a fresh install, the database config file `mysite/_config.php` will need to be given 0777 permissions.
`suitecrm7`         | Fork     |
`wordpress4`        | Fork     |
`wordpress5`        | Fork     |

`xenforo1`          | Download |
`xenforo2`          | Download |
`zendframework2`    | Fork     | Your best bet is to start from the [zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication) GitHub project. Catapult assumes Zend Framework is at the root of your repo and writes a database config file at `config/autoload/global.php`, you will also need to set `webroot: public/` in your Catapult configuration.

### Software Auto Updates ###

The below table outlines what software is supported for the `software_auto_update` website option. When this option is set to `true`, Catapult manages software core and pluggable component (plugins, modules, etc.) updates to the latest compatible versions using the software's CLI tool or similar method.

In the scenario where an update may overwrite customizations to a file that is expected to be able to be customized (e.g. `.htaccess`, `.gitignore`, or `robots.txt`), you may create an `_append` directory within the repository root of the website with files containing your customizations.

* The files in `~/_append/` will be appended to files in `~/{webroot}/`
* The append filenames must match the filenames that you would like to append.
* The append files must only contain the lines of content that you would like to append.
* Please note that only files that allow for hash style comments (i.e. `# THIS IS A COMMENT`) are supported.
* Please note that only files that are in the root of the website's `webroot` are supported.

### HTTPS and Certificates ###

Catapult manages free Domain Validation (DV) certificates compliments of Cloudflare and Let's Encrypt automatically for all of your websites and optionally manages purchased certificates.

It's important to note that certificates are not dependent on protocols. Many vendors tend to use the phrase "SSL/TLS certificate", it may be more accurate to call them "certificates for use with SSL and TLS" since the protocols are determined by your server configuration, not the certificates themselves. It's likely you will continue to see certificates referred to as SSL certificates because at this point that’s the term more people are familiar with, however, we're just calling them "certificates".

**Browser Compatibility**

Catapult tracks Mozilla's Operations Security (OpSec) team Security/Server Side TLS recommendations document and the "Intermediate" recommended configuration and is our objective to maintain at least an A rating with [Qualys Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=devopsgroup.io&latest). An important note is that Catapult does not support old browsers that do not support Server Name Indication (SNI). Here is Catapult's list of oldest compatible browsers:

* Chrome 1
* Internet Explorer 7 / Windows Vista
* Internet Explorer 8 / Windows 7
* Firefox 1
* Safari 1

**Purchased Certificates**

Depending on your compliance needs you may need to purchase custom certificates unique to your organization. Below is a table of the three different types of certificates that should be taken into account when auditing your compliance needs.

Feature                                        | Domain Validation (DV certificates)                                                          | Organization Validation (OV certificates)                                                   | Extended Validation (EV certificates)

Catapult optionally manages custom certificates purchased and issued by a Certificate Authority. The following files are required for Catapult to detect and use the custom certificate:

* A bundled file that contains the Root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and any Intermediate Certificate Authority certificates
    * CA root and intermediate certificate files can be combined like this `cat COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt COMODORSAAddTrustCA.crt AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt >> example_com.ca-bundle`
* The certificate file
* The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) including the CSR file and private key file
    * Generated with `openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.csr`
    * Your Certificate Signing Request file
    * Your private key file

Here is an example of a certificate implementation for example.com:

* `reporoot/_cert/example_com/example_com.ca-bundle`
* `reporoot/_cert/example_com/example_com.crt`
* `reporoot/_cert/example_com/server.csr`
* `reporoot/_cert/example_com/server.key`

Here is an example of a certificate implementation for dev.example.com:

* `reporoot/_cert/dev_example_com/dev_example_com.ca-bundle`
* `reporoot/_cert/dev_example_com/dev_example_com.crt`
* `reporoot/_cert/dev_example_com/server.csr`
* `reporoot/_cert/dev_example_com/server.key`

**Note:** If you have a wildcard certificate, duplicate each environment directory and use the same set of files

### Forcing www ###

Forcing www is generally software-specific, unlike forcing the HTTPS protocol, which is environment-specific and driven by the `force_https` option. To force www ([why force www?](http://www.yes-www.org/)), please follow the respective guides per `software` below.

For `software` that does not have specific documentation, please follow this generic `.htaccess` approach http://stackoverflow.com/a/4958847/4838803

### Debug Output ###

Debug output, unlike logging, is a configuration that outputs exceptions on-screen of your website while you're developing in LocalDev for convenience. It also aligns with the testing activies as defined in [Release Management](#release-management). Debug output is configured at two levels; PHP and software-specific, the below chart provides a breakdown.

| LocalDev | Test | QC | Production
|----------|------|----|-----------
| Verbose | Verbose | Hidden | Hidden


### Cache Busting ###

Caching plays a very important role in the performance of your website and enforces and recommends many [performance optimizations](#performance). Catapult generally enforces caching of files to [1 year](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/cache-policy), because of this, to ensure that a new website release is reflected in a user's browser you should consider [semantic versioning]((http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)) of website resource files. Here's an example of query string cache busting:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.min.css?v=3.4.1">`

Ready to deploy a new release? Update the version number and the cache will be "busted":

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.min.css?v=3.4.2">`

A more complicated, yet effective method of cache-busting is by using versioned folders. Resources with a "?" in the URL are not cached by some proxy caching servers. Here is an example of URL path cache busting:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/3.4.1/style.min.css">`

Ready to deploy a new release? Update the version number and the cache will be "busted":

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/3.4.2/style.min.css">`

Each software type will vary as to the standard convention of website resource file versioning, here is a [Wordpress example](https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/90824) to get you started.

### Progressive Web App ###
Progressive Web App (PWA), in general, is a term used to denote web apps that use the latest web technologies. Catapult allows a `manifest.json` file to be placed in your `webroot`. Note that this will be accessible regardless of whether or not you are using the `force_auth` option, which is necessary because `manifest.json` is sometimes accessed outside of the session under which you authenticated. Don't forget to include the `link` tag `<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">` to notify the browser of your manifest. More information regarding PWAs can be found at Google's [Web App Manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/) and [Progressive Web App Checklist](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist).

### Email ###

**SMTP: SendGrid**

Email delivery is an art, there are many considerations when trying to get an email into someone's inbox. Some considerations include message encryption, authentication, IP reputation, bounce management, analytics visibility, [and more](https://sendgrid.com/email-delivery/). For that reason, Catapult requires the setup of the managed SMTP relay provider, SendGrid. To configure SendGrid with your website's software, please set the SMTP configuration to the following:

* SMTP host: `smtp.sendgrid.net`
* SMTP port: `587`
* Encryption: `TLS`
* Authentication: `yes`
* Username: `~/secrets/configuration.yml["company"]["sendgrid_username"]`
* Password: `~/secrets/configuration.yml["company"]["sendgrid_password"]`

An example implementation would be the [WP Mail SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/) WordPress plugin.

**SMTP: Default**

If you do not use SendGrid as your SMTP relay provider in your website software SMTP configuration, then the following default configurations will apply to assist with email deliverability:

* SPF DNS record: If your website's domain is configured to use Cloudflare, Catapult will automatically configure an SPF record for each environment.
* TLS message encryption: If the receiving mail server supports it, the message will be TLS encrypted.

**Bounce Management**

* **With SendGrid:** Catapult automatically configures SendGrid to forward bounces to your `~/secrets/configuration.yml["company"]["email"]` to clear hard bounces every 5 days and soft bounces every 3 days.
* **Without SendGrid:** Postfix will retry sending every hour for five days. Catapult cron looks for bounces and emails them to your `~/secrets/configuration.yml["company"]["email"]` daily.

### Upload Limits ###

The following HTTP request limits are defined for all websites:

**HTTP (ModSecurity) Limits**

* Maximum request body size excluding the size of any files being transported in the request (`SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit`): `1 MB`
   * Limits the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` Content-Type
* Maximum request body size (`SecRequestBodyLimit`): `64 MB`
   * Limits the `multi-part` Content-Type
   
**PHP Limits**

* Maximum size of an uploaded file (`upload_max_filesize`): `16 MB`
* Maximum size of post data allowed (`post_max_size`): `64 MB`

**Troubleshooting**

If you are experiencing `401` or `413` HTTP response codes it may be due to the HTTP client not supporting the HTTP 1.1 `Expect` header. This header essentially says "I've got a huge payload, but before I send it please let me know if you can handle it". This gives the endpoints time to renegotiate the client certificate before the payload is sent. The `SSLRenegBufferSize` is set to `128 KB` for security reasons, so if your payload exceeds this size it will fail if the client does not support the HTTP 1.1 `Expect` header. Read more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14281628/ssl-renegotiation-with-client-certificate-causes-server-buffer-overflow/15394058#15394058).

### Database Migrations ###

The best way to handle changes to the software's database schema is through a migrations system. Database migrations are software-specific and are invoked via Catapult for you, here we outline the specifics:

### Refreshing Databases ###

* Databases are dumped once per day to the `~/_sql` folder and restored, dependent on the environment and `software_workflow` setting per website - see [Release Management](#release-management) for details.
* Leverage Catapult's workflow model (configured by `software_workflow`) to trigger a database refresh. From the develop branch, commit a deletion of today's database backup lock file from the `~/_sql` folder.

### Connecting to Databases ###

Oracle SQL Developer is the recommended tool, to connect to and work with databases. It is free, commercially supported, cross-platform, and supports multiple database types.

* **Download and install** [Oracle SQL Developer](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html), some platforms require the [Java SE Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* **Install third-party JDBC drivers**: Oracle SQL Developer uses JDBC, via a .jar file, to connect to different database types. To install a new JDBC connector, download the respective .jar file then from Oracle SQL Developer > Preferences > Database > Third Party JDBC Drivers, click Add Entry.<sup>[4](#references)</sup>
    * **MySQL** http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.0.html
        * For convenience, you may also use `~/catapult/installers/mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar`
    * **MSSQL** https://sourceforge.net/projects/jtds/files/jtds/
        * For convenience, you may also use `~/catapult/installers/jtds-1.3.1.jar`
* **Connecting to:** LocalDev
    * The firewall allows direct connection to the database server. 
        * From Oracle SQL Developer > View > Connections, add a New Connection with the respective environment's mysql user values in `~/secrets/configuration.yml`.
* **Connecting to:** Test, QC, Production
    * The firewall does not allow a direct mysql connection to the database servers.
        * From Oracle SQL Developer > View > SSH, add a New SSH Host in Oracle SQL Developer with the respective environment's mysql server host public IP address, root username with key file at `~/secrets/id_rsa`.
            * Create a New Local Port Forward with 127.0.0.1 as the IP address and port 3306.
        * From Oracle SQL Developer > View > Connections, add a New Connection with the respective environment's mysql user values in `~/secrets/configuration.yml`.
            * The hostname will be localhost since we are forwarding the port through our local SSH tunnel.

### Production Hotfixes ###

Always weigh the risk of *not performing* a production hotfix versus *performing* it, as production hotfixes require going outside of the normal development and testing workflow. Below is an example of how you can determine severity:

Ask key stakeholders the following questions and assign a 1 or 0 for the answer, then add up the total:

* What is the organizational risk?
    * High = 1 or Low = 0
* How many users does this affect?
    * Many = 1 or Few = 0
* Is there a workaround?
    * No = 1 or Yes = 0
* What is the user impact?
    * High = 1 or Low = 0

The total will determine the level of severity, typically a 4 would be considered a candidate for a production hotfix:

* 0=Tolerate
* 1=Trivial
* 2=Minor
* 3=Major
* 4=Critical

Performing a production hotfix varies depending on the website's `software` type, `software_workflow` direction, and type of change (code or database).

* `software_workflow: downstream`
    * **Code**
        1. In `~/configuration.yml`, temporarily set the environments -> dev -> branch key to `branch: master`, and do not commit the change
        2. Provision any related LocalDev servers
        3. Develop, test, then commit any changes directly to the `master` branch
        4. Run the Production Bamboo build and verify the release
        5. Create a pull request and merge the `master` branch into the `develop` branch
        6. Set the environments -> dev -> branch key back to `branch: develop`
        7. Provision any related LocalDev servers
    * **Database**
        * Login to the Production website and make the change
            * (any database change that is beyond the direct capability of the `software` should not be taken out as a production hotfix)
* `software_workflow: upstream`
    * **Code**
        1. In `~/configuration.yml`, temporarily set the environments -> dev -> branch key to `branch: master`, and do not commit the change
        2. Provision any related LocalDev servers
        3. Develop, test, then commit any changes directly to the `master` branch
        4. Run the Production build and verify the release
        5. Create a pull request and merge the `master` branch into the `develop` branch
        6. Set the environments -> dev -> branch key back to `branch: develop`
        7. Provision any related LocalDev servers
    * **Database**
        1. Login to the Production *and* Test website and make the change
            * (any database change that is beyond the direct capability of logging into the `software` and safely making the change, should not be taken out as a production hotfix)
        2. From LocalDev and the `develop` branch of the website's repository, commit a deletion of today's (if exists) SQL dump file from within the `~/sql` folder
            * (this ensures there is a known committed SQL dump of your change to the `develop` branch for when this branch is merged upstream)
        3. From LocalDev, temporarily checkout the `master` branch of the website's repository, make your change in the most recent SQL dump file from within the `~/sql` folder
            * (this ensures that during the next Production build your change is not overwritten)



## Automated Deployment Cycle ##

The automated deployment cycle releases changesets merged into respective environment branches for websites and your Catapult configuration, in addition to running server updates.

Environment | Scheduled
----------- | ---------
LocalDev    | n/a, requires provision
Test        | 12:00 AM
QC          | 1:00 AM
Production  | 2:00 AM

* Operating System and server software updates
* [Website software updates](#software-auto-updates)
* [Website repository changesets](#software-workflow)
* [Website software database restores](#software-workflows)
* [Website software database migrations](#database-migrations)
* [Website software database backups](#software-workflows)



## Maintenance Cycle ##

A maintenance cycle is scheduled for defined times within the timezone that is defined within `~/secrets/configuration.yml` at the `timezone_redhat` and `timezone_windows` values of the [Company](#company) entry. This ensures system and website software are patched and other security controls are run within your infrastructure to automatically mitigate security vulnerabilities.

### Daily ###
Daily maintenance occurs:

* Red Hat - 3:05 AM
* Windows - 2:00 AM

Daily maintenance includes:

* Updating Operating System and server software
* Rotating logs
* Discovering mail that has failed to send

### Weekly ###

Weekly maintenance occurs:

* Red Hat - Sunday 3:25 AM
* Windows - Sunday 3:00 AM

Weekly maintenance includes:

* [Security Preventive Controls](#preventive-controls)
* [Security Detective Controls](#detective-controls)
* [Security Corrective Controls](#corrective-controls)
* [Auto-rewew HTTPS certificate](#https-and-certificates)
* Git garbage collection for website repositories
* Performing database maintenance

Servers will be rebooted when:

* Red Hat - a kernel update is staged
* Windows - Microsoft Update indicates a restart is required



## Disaster Recovery ##

Being able to react to disasters immediately and consistently is crucial - Catapult affords you fast rebuilding and rollbacks.

### Server Rebuilding ###

* LocalDev is rebuildable by running `vagrant destroy` and then `vagrant up` for the respective virtual machine.
* Test, QC, and Production are rebuildable by running `vagrant rebuild` for the respective virtual machine - this is necessary (rather than a destroy and up) to retain the IP addresses of the machine.

### Website Rollbacks ###

**Production Website Rollbacks:**

* `software_workflow: upstream`
    * Files
        * Reverse the offending merge commit from the master branch and run the Production deployment.
    * Database
        * Reverse the offending merge commit from the master branch and run the Production deployment.
        * Note: The Production database is overwritten and restored from the latest sql dump file from Test in the `~/_sql` folder.
* `software_workflow: downstream`
    * Files
        * Reverse the offending merge commit from the master branch and run the Production deployment.
    * Database
        * Reverse the offending database dump auto-commit from the develop branch and manually restore the Production database from the desired sql dump file in the `~/_sql` folder.
        * Note: The Production database is dumped once per day when the production build is run.



# Security #

Catapult enforces many security best practices that are important for you to be aware of and understand. These controls avoid, detect, counteract, or minimize security risks to the platform and visitors. The [Lynis](https://cisofy.com/lynis/) security auditing tool is used to evaluate and harden the configuration of the system.

## Preventive Controls ##

**Edge**

* \*DDoS protection
* \*Bad browser
* \*Bad IP from Project Honeypot and Cloudflare's Threat Score list

**Server**

* Hardened kernel and network interface configuration
* Hardened SSH configuration including key-only authentication
* Strict firewall ruleset
* Automatic weekly kernel updates

**Application**

* [OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_ModSecurity_Core_Rule_Set_Project) Apache rules
* [Mozilla OpSec](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS) strict HTTPS protocol and cipher suite
* [OWASP Secure Headers Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Headers_Project#tab=Headers) recommended HTTP response headers
* Automatic hourly application updates

**Software**

* Strict directory and file permissions
* Automatic software updates during a build

\* This security feature only takes effect when the website's nameservers are set to CloudFlare

## Detective Controls ##

* ARPwatch (Address Resolution Protocol) notifies of changed MAC/IP pairings
* Fail2Ban filters for sshd, sshd-ddos, and apache-botsearch
* SysStat collects and stores system performance and usage activity
* Weekly report of 404s and error keywords targeted at the server and virtual hosts

## Corrective Controls ##

* Weekly ClamAV antivirus scan of website files

## Data Protection ##

Catapult introduces many best practice data protection measures, however, the security of personal data is ultimately your responsibility. Generally speaking, if personal information is compromised, you are required by law to notify the party. Laws vary country-by-country and state-by-state and can be enforceable in the state or country where the individual is physically located when the data is collected. This means that, even if your website is hosted within the U.S., you could potentially be subject to another country's data protection laws. The main principles of data protection include:

* Privacy by design
* Right to access
* Right to be forgotten
* Data portability
* Breach notification

### United States ###

Personally identifiable information (PII), in the U.S., is generally classified as **an individual's first and last name in combination with a Social Security number, driver's license number, or financial account number**. For more information, please see [this list](http://www.itgovernanceusa.com/data-breach-notification-laws.aspx) of data breach laws by U.S. states compiled by IT Governance.

### Europe ###

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in E.U. law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union that becomes enforceable starting May 25, 2018. Article 4(1) of the GDPR defines "personal data" as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. For more information, please see the [GDPR](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32016R0679).

# Performance #

Your website's performance is maximized with bandwidth, caching, and geographic optimizations. Catapult enforces these throughout every layer of your website, all in an effort to improve page loading times. Below is an example of the great performance gain of when page caching and CSS/JS aggregation are enabled for a Drupal website - all of which is managed by Catapult.

**Please note:** Any performance optimization that would impact development or component testing in LocalDev is disabled; this workflow aligns with the testing activites described in the [Release Management](#release-management) section.

## Bandwidth Optimizations ##

Bandwidth optimizations are made to lower the total bytes downloaded and decrease the amount of requests made by the browser.

* HTTP Content-Encoding headers are set for a defined list of files, this will compress the file sent from the server to the client using gzip. This saves network bandwidth and total time for the client to download the file.
* Aggregating CSS and JavaScript files is enabled for the website's software type if available.
  * [https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/catapult/blob/master/provisioners/redhat/modules/software_operations_meta.sh](https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/catapult/blob/master/provisioners/redhat/modules/software_operations_meta.sh)

## Caching Optimizations ##

Caching is enabled for many layers of your website including storing pre-interpreted PHP in memory, storing page caches for certain software types, and storing files on visitor's local disk.

* Zend OPcache is enabled for faster PHP execution through opcode caching and optimization.
  * [https://secure.php.net/manual/en/intro.opcache.php](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/intro.opcache.php)
* Page caching is enabled for the website's software type if available.
  * [https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/catapult/blob/master/provisioners/redhat/modules/software_operations_meta.sh](https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/catapult/blob/master/provisioners/redhat/modules/software_operations_meta.sh)
* HTTP Cache-Control headers are set to expire browser-cached files after a default of 7 days; longer for specific file types.
  * [https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/catapult/blob/master/provisioners/redhat/modules/apache_vhosts.sh](https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/catapult/blob/master/provisioners/redhat/modules/apache_vhosts.sh)
* HTTP ETag headers are set for all files, the ETag is a unique value based on the file modified time and size in bytes. If the ETag value is unchanged then a cached version is served if available. This saves network bandwidth.
  * [https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/catapult/blob/master/provisioners/redhat/modules/apache_vhosts.sh](https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/catapult/blob/master/provisioners/redhat/modules/apache_vhosts.sh)

## Geographic Optimizations ##

Shortening the physical distance between the server and the visitor can trim priceless milliseconds from page loading time. (One might use this as an argument as to why browser caching and your overall caching strategy is so important.)

* If your website's name servers are set to Cloudflare, you will take advantage of files being cached across their global network, bringing it closer to visitors from every region.
  * [https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172516-Which-file-extensions-does-Cloudflare-cache-for-static-content-](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172516-Which-file-extensions-does-Cloudflare-cache-for-static-content-)

## Recommended Optimizations ##

Catapult as a platform can only reach so far into the configuration of your website's software. Here are a few recommended development practices that will improve the performance of your website:

* Use a development task automation tool, like [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to perform the following:
  * Image compression with [imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-imagemin)
  * JavaScript minification with [UglifyJS2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify)
  * CSS minification with [clean-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-clean-css)
  * Concatenate minified JavaScript and CSS to reduce the number of HTTP requests
* Execute `<script>` tags [asynchronously](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-async)
    * Note that asynchronous scripts are not guaranteed to execute in specified order
* Execute `<script>` tags after the document has been parsed with [defer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-defer)
    * Note this is the same as placing script tags just before the `</body>` tag
* Use [CSS sprites](https://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/) to reduce the number of HTTP requests
* Take advantage of [resource prioritization](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/resource-prioritization) using `rel="prefetch"`
* Take advantage of [cross-origin performance gains](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener) for external `target="_blank"` links, use `rel="noopener"`
* Write [PHP the right way](http://www.phptherightway.com/#welcome)
  * Practice [self-documenting code](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0132350882/)
* Write [efficient PHP](http://www.phpbench.com/)

Google's [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) and [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) are good tools to test for performance optimizations.



# Capacity #

Your website's capacity potential is defined by two key elements; 1) your website's average resource requirement per request and 2) server resources available. We recommend to first [Performance](#performance) optimize your website and *then* consider your website's capacity potential through [Performance and Capacity Testing](#performance-and-capacity-testing).

## Increasing Capacity ##

Catapult defines horizontal scaling by adding additional servers, this affords you increased capacity. Currently, only the Red Hat stack supports horizontal scaling and only one (1) additional server is supported. Each Red Hat environment (LocalDev, Test, QC, and Production) supports horizontal scaling independently. To spin up the additional server per environment, please run the following command:

    * `vagrant up ~/secrets/configuration.yml["company"]["name"]-dev-redhat1`
    * `vagrant up ~/secrets/configuration.yml["company"]["name"]-test-redhat1`
    * `vagrant up ~/secrets/configuration.yml["company"]["name"]-qc-redhat1`
    * `vagrant up ~/secrets/configuration.yml["company"]["name"]-production-redhat1`
    
## Load Balancer

HAProxy is used to facilitate capacity management by means of a layer 7 load balancer. The HAProxy status dashboard is made available to you for each environment by visiting port 32700 at the respective environment's `-redhat` server `ip` address as defined in `~/secrets/configuration.yml`. As example, `42.67.232.56:32700`. The username to log in is `admin` and the password is the password as defined at the respective environment's `["software"]["admin_password"]` entry.



# Performance and Capacity Testing #

Often disregarded, performance and capacity testing are crucial components of quality assurance. The risks of neglecting performance and capacity testing include downtime, SEO impacts, gaps in analytics, poor user experience, and unknown ability to scale.

With Catapult's exactly duplicated configuration, even the Test environment can accurately represent the performance and capacity potential of the Production environment. [ApacheBench](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) is a powerful tool to test request performance and concurrency - macOS includes ApacheBench out of the box, while [this StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7407602/4838803) details how to get up and running on Windows.

ApacheBench enables us to perform both performance and capacity testing. Each website has its own unique resource requirements and knowing these requirements are paramount to the performance, capacity, and uptime of your website. 

* **Performance testing**
  * *Definition*: Testing for the time it takes for a client to request a web page from the server.
  * *Why*: Enables us to see real-world request times for our website.
  * *How to improve*: Please reference the [Performance](#performance) section and its many optimization recommendations.

* **Capacity testing**
  * *Definition*: Testing many concurrent requests at a time to uncover when performance begins to degrade.
  * *Why*: Enables us to see real-world capacity limits for our website's unique resource fingerprint.
  * *How to improve*: Please reference the [Capacity](#capacity) section and its many optimization recommendations.

## Website Concurrency Maximum ##

Using a website with historical Google Analytics data, access the Audience Overview and find the busiest Pageview day from the past 30 days, and then drill into that date. Find the hour with the most page views, and then the accompanying Avg. Session Duration. Using the following formula, we are able to find the Concurrency Maxiumum.

*(Pageviews x Avg. Session Duration in seconds) / 3,600 seconds* = **Concurrency Maximum**

<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/devopsgroup-io/catapult/master/catapult/installers/images/catapult_website_concurrency_maximum.png" alt="Catapult Website Concurrency Maximum">

**365,000 pageviews per month**

Take a website with an average of 500 pageviews per hour, or 365,000 pageviews per month, which has a busiest hour of 1,000 pageviews.

Pageviews | Avg. Session Duration | Total Session Seconds | Concurrency Maximum
----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------
1,000 | 60 minutes (3,600 seconds) | 3,600,000 | **1,000**
1,000 | 10 minutes (600 seconds) | 600,000 | **166**
1,000 | 5 minutes (300 seconds) | 300,000 | **88**
1,000 | 1 minute (60 seconds) | 60,000 | **16**

*100 concurrent requests performed 10 times*
```
ab -l -r -n 1000 -c 100 -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate" http://test.drupal7.devopsgroup.io/
```

**14,600 pageviews per month**

Take a website with an average of 20 pageviews per hour, or 14,600 pageviews per month, which has a busiest hour of 100 pageviews.

Pageviews | Avg. Session Duration | Total Session Seconds | Concurrency Maximum
----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------
100 | 60 minutes (3,600 seconds) | 36,000 | **1,000**
100 | 10 minutes (600 seconds) | 60,000 | **16**
100 | 5 minutes (300 seconds) | 30,000 | **8**
100 | 1 minute (60 seconds) | 6,000 | **1.6**

*10 concurrent requests performed 10 times*
```
ab -l -r -n 100 -c 10 -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate" http://test.drupal7.devopsgroup.io/
```

# How-to #

This section outlines Catapult usage and maintenance.

## Vagrant Convenience Commands ##

In the LocalDev environment, convenience commands are provided for use with Vagrant. These allow you to execute `reload`, `provision`, or `up` against both dev environment VMs with a single command. Simply use `dev` as the machine name; e.g. `vagrant reload dev` or `vagrant provision dev`.



## Rotating Secrets ##

As your team members change, there may be a need to rotate Catapult secrets. The following is the recommended method and order to do so.

1. **GPG Passphrase**
   1. Disable all Bamboo build plans
   2. Generate a new GPG passphrase, as described in the [Instance Setup](#instance-setup), and place it at `~/secrets/configuration-user.yml["settings"]["gpg_key"]`
   3. Encrypt the file `~secrets/configuration.yml` with the new GPG passphrase: `gpg --verbose --batch --yes --passphrase "[insert newly generated passphrase here]" --output secrets/configuration.yml.gpg --armor --cipher-algo AES256 --symmetric secrets/configuration.yml`
   4. Encrypt the file `~secrets/id_rsa` with the new GPG passphrase: `gpg --verbose --batch --yes --passphrase "[insert newly generated passphrase here]" --output secrets/id_rsa.gpg --armor --cipher-algo AES256 --symmetric secrets/id_rsa`
   5. Encrypt the file `~secrets/secrets/id_rsa.pub` with the new GPG passphrase: `gpg --verbose --batch --yes --passphrase "[insert newly generated passphrase here]" --output secrets/id_rsa.pub.gpg --armor --cipher-algo AES256 --symmetric secrets/id_rsa.pub`
   6. Commit the updated files to the `develop` branch, then ensure the TEST Bamboo build plan's jobs have the updated GPG passphrase, and run the build for confirmation.
   7. Create and merge a pull request from `develop` into the `release` branch, then ensure the QC Bamboo build plan's jobs have the updated GPG passphrase, and run the build for confirmation.
   8. Create and merge a pull request from `release` into the `master` branch, then ensure the PROD Bamboo build plan's jobs have the updated GPG passphrase, and run the build for confirmation. 
2. **Bamboo Server**
   1. Login to the Bamboo Server and change the password
   2. With GPG Edit Mode enabled, update `~/secrets/configuration.yml` with the new credential and commit
3. **DigitalOcean**
   1. Login to DigitalOcean and generate a new personal access token and delete the old
   2. With GPG Edit Mode enabled, update `~/secrets/configuration.yml` with the new credential and commit
4. **Bitbucket**
   1. Login to Bitbucket and change the password
   2. With GPG Edit Mode enabled, update `~/secrets/configuration.yml` with the new credential and commit
5. **GitHub**
   1. Login to GitHub and change the password, generate a new personal access token and delete the old
   2. With GPG Edit Mode enabled, update `~/secrets/configuration.yml` with the new credential and commit



# Troubleshooting #

Below is a log of service-related troubleshooting. If you're having issues related to Catapult, [submit a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/catapult/issues/new).

* **Apple Silicon (M1 and M2 chips)**
  * When using Catapult with a Mac computer with [Apple silicon](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211814), you will need to set `~/secrets/configuration-user.yml["settings"]["provider_dev"]` to `vmware_fusion`

* **Vagrant**
  * When upgrading Vagrant you may run into errors - the most common issue is mismatched plugins, running this command has a good chance of success `sudo rm -Rf ~/.vagrant.d/gems/ && sudo rm ~/.vagrant.d/plugins.json`
  * Mac OS Sonoma is locked to Vagrant 2.3.4 and the following Vagrant plugins:
    - `vagrant plugin install highline --plugin-version=2.1.0`
    - `vagrant plugin install faraday --plugin-version=2.7.4`
    - `vagrant plugin install vagrant-digitalocean --plugin-version=0.9.6`

  * Submit a pull request
  * Report an issue
  * Provide feedback on open issues
  * Improve documentation in the README
  * Share your experiences with Catapult

When you first set Catapult, a `develop-catapult` branch is created for you under your forked repository with the git remote upstream set to `https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/catapult.git` so that you can easily create a pull request. Also keep in mind when closing issues to submit a pull request that includes [GitHub's: Closing issues via commit messages](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).



## Releases ##

Releases are driven by the devopsgroup.io team and occur when accepting new pull requests from contributors like you. Releases follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.

In addition, the release version number will be prefaced with a `v` (v1.0.0) to conform to standard practice.

As part of a new release, the version number in `~/VERSION.yml` will be incremented and git tagged with the same version number along with a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases/).
